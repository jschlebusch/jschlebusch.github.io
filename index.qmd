# Welcome!

I am a student of nationalism, researching states' nation-building policies.
I hold a Research Master's degree in International Studies from the [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals](https://www.ibei.org/en) and currently work as a Research Assistant for the ERC-funded [ETHNICGOODS](https://ethnicgoods.org/)-project at the same institution.

On this website, you can find out more about my [professional interests](about.qmd), my [work](publications.qmd) and my ongoing projects. Any relevant data and code produced will be available here or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jschlebusch). Occasional updates are also posted on [twitter](https://twitter.com/janschlebusx) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-schlebusch-57264b288/).

Please feel free to explore this website and to get in [touch](mailto:jschlebusch@student.ibei.org).

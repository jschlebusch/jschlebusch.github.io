I completed the Research Master's in International Studies at the [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals](https://www.ibei.org/en), studying nationalism and ethnic politics.

Currently working as a Research Assistant in the ERC-funded [ETHNICGOODS](https://ethnicgoods.org/)-project led by Prof. Matthias vom Hau which explores variation in nation-building policies and their particular consequences, I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse states' governance of ethnic diversity.

My further research interests lie in territoriality, the territorialisation of collective identities, and the spatial dynamics of state formation and nation building as well as inter-group conflict.
More specifically, I am researching how states build homelands. Regionally, I am particularly focused on Asia and Latin America, having spent several months at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in Taipei, Taiwan, and repeatedly extensive time in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.

Collaborative work in progress includes, among other things, the mapping of state-sponsored cultural genocide world wide since 1945, and an analysis of patterns in nation-building strategies among Latin American states.

Please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:jschlebusch@student.ibei.org).
If I do not respond right away, I am probably off exploring the wonderful world of Oolong teas but will get back to you as soon as possible.

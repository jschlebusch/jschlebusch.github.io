    "text": "Since the 1950s, the People’s Republic of China sponsored migration of Han people into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), notably employing the Xinjiang Construction and Production Corps as vehicle. After initial waves of Han inflow ebbed down, the 1990s and 2000s, again, witnessed demographic engineering campaigns in the course of which the government sought to incentivise Han immigration into Xinjiang.1 This continues today.2\nDemographic engineering and internal colonialisation are generally considered to have affected the demographic balance in the region. Whereas Uyghurs constituted a majority across the region in the past, they are now a mere plurality in some of their traditional settlement areas; in many places the number of Han even exceeds the number of Uyghurs. Yet, there is notable sub-regional variance in the degree of diversity and the change therein.\nThe Ethnic Diversity in Xinjiang Dataset seeks to map changes in ethnic heterogeneity at the county level based on official government statistics, providing the degree of ethnic fractionalisation3 and ethnic polarisation4 for each county-year. To access the data set, please refer to the Data section of this website. Additional visualizations are already available here.\nThe dataset uniquely allows to test - and challenge - assumptions regarding the link between ethnic diversity and development5 and ethnic diversity and conflict6 at the sub-national level, and to further explore the extent to which ethnic demographics are not, as often assumed, exogenous to inter-group conflict but shaped thereby.7 An initial review of the figures below against the background of the history of ethnic violence in Xinjiang already indicates that neither the most fractionalised nor the most polarised counties can clearly be associated with the occurrence of violent events. Crucially, the data also facilitates the systematic analysis of the effects of demographic engineering, thus far rarely addressed. As such, I hope that the data set contributes to generating new insights into how ethnic demographics and inter-group relations are mediated by politics and the effects that interference with the ‘demographic facts on the ground’ can have.\nTo learn more about the dataset, avenues it opens for further research, and its relevance beyond the case of Xinjiang, please consult: Schlebusch, J. (2024). Introducing the Ethnic Diversity in Xinjiang Dataset."

More specifically, I am researching how states build homelands. Regionally, I am particularly focused on Asia and Latin America, having spent several months at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan, and repeatedly extensive time in Asunción, Paraguay.\nCollaborative work in progress includes, among other things, the mapping of state-sponsored cultural genocide world wide since 1945, and an analysis of patterns in nation-building strategies among Latin American states.\nPlease feel free to send me an email. If I do not respond right away, I am probably off exploring the wonderful world of Oolong teas but will get back to you as soon as possible."
